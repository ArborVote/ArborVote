**ArborVote** is a tool for rational decision-making based on arguments.
The key idea of this project is to stake/quadratic vote ðŸ—³ on a binary tree ðŸŒ³ of pro and con arguments instead of directly voting for or against a decision.
In the end, the cumulative weight of the arguments summed from the branches to the root of the tree determines the decision.
Governance forms  based on arguments are not new and known under the term [deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy).

Decision-making based on arguments is unpopular because of the bureaucratic overhead connected to it. 
A centralized platform ([kialo.com](https://www.kialo.com)) overcame this issue and does a great job by
* keeping debates **rational**
* presenting debates in a **structured and transparent** way and thus 
* allowing for **fast onboarding of participants** 

([see an exemplary debate](https://www.kialo.com/humans-should-act-to-fight-climate-change-4540)). 
Participants create a binary tree of pro and con arguments and can express preference by voting on them.
Still, the platform is not designed for actual voting because it lacks resilience against manipulation and sybil attacks.

This gap can be filled with blockchain technology by
* adding a safe and **quadratic voting system** and 
* providing **economic incentives** for participation.

Argument-based decision-making could be a useful building block in future DAOs.

## Algorithm Outline  (Work in Progress)
### Creation Phase
* A user creates a debate by creating a proposal is the root of a binary tree.
* Users can create pro or con arguments.
* Arguments can be nested.

After creation (and editing) phase, the binary tree gets finalized. The voting phase begins.

### Voting Phase
* Voters have a limited number of votes and can (quadratically) vote on arguments.
* Votes are cumulatively summed up from the bottom of the binary tree and determine the decision outcome
* Special rule: Bad arguments with negative cumulative votes are counted with a weight of zero 
(Rationale: Bad arguments can't influence the decision process and are sorted out on the lowest possible level.)

## Project Structure
This project has the following structure:

```md
root
â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”œ â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”œ â””â”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts
â”œ â””â”€â”€ CounterApp.sol
â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”œâ”€â”€ arapp.json
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”œâ”€â”€ buidler.config.js
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

## Running the app

To run the app in a browser with front end plus back end hot reloading, simply run `npm start`.


### npm Scripts

- **postinstall**: Runs after installing dependencies.
- **build-app**: Installs front end project (app/) dependencies.
- **start** Runs your app inside a DAO.
- **compile**: Compiles the smart contracts.
- **test**: Runs tests for the contracts.
